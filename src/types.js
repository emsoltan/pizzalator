      "also known as sfincione , focaccia,  thick-crust, deep-dish or pan pizza. <br/>The Sicilian pizza is a very versatile pizza that goes by lots of different names, depending on the region, city, or country where it’s made. <br/>Though the name and the toppings may vary a lot, the basics stay the same.<br/>These pizzas have a thicker, softer, and more bread-like texture than the Neapolitan, Roman or New York pizza. <br/>They’re baked in a pan or baking tray that’s coated heavily with olive oil. <br/>As the oil heats up in the oven, it will fry the base of the pizza, making it super crispy and delicious.",
